## Vouchers full stack app

This is a full stack demonstration of a **Vouchers** system where user is able to create,read, update and delete a Voucher.
A voucher has three attributes: 
- Name : string.

- Add more attributes to a Voucher such as : validity(years, days, or from-to date) and allowed number of usages.
